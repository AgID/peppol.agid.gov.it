It is recalled that, on the basis of paragraph 9.4.8 of the Agreement signed between the Peppol Service Providers and the national Peppol Authority, the Service Providers are obliged to make available to the Peppol Coordinating Authority of OpenPeppol, on a monthly basis, a set of data statistics that allow you to monitor the operations performed on the Peppol network, identify and manage risks and problems within the network itself.

Based on the information available to date, the reporting activities of the SPs towards OpenPeppol will presumably be launched during the third quarter of 2023 and will concern the periodic collection of data relating to the volumes of incoming and outgoing transactions of the Access Point of the SP.

AgID will provide further information on this as soon as they are available.
