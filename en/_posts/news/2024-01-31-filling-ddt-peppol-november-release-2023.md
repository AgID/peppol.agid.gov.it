**We inform you that from 02/26/2024**, at the same time as the entry into force of the **Peppol November Release 2023**, the activation of blocking controls on DDTs is expected (change of severity from **"WARNING" to "FATAL"**)  that do not comply with the Business rules for the Peppol Transport Document.

Consequently, **any documents that do not comply with the Rules will be discarded by the schematron (validation XLST v.3.1.0)**.

Please note that the Business Rules for the DDT can be consulted **in the *[next release](https://peppol-docs.agid.gov.it/docs-next-release/my_index.jsp)* environment** and that AgID has made available the [Peppol document validator tool](https://peppol-validator.agid.gov.it/) which allows the sender of the DDT the possibility of independently verifying the conformity of an xml document to the current schematron, including those of the DDT.
