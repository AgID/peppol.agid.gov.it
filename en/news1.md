## Migration to the PEPPOL AS4 profile - AS4 AP acceptance test

Following the [official communication](https://peppol.eu/support-for-the-peppol-as4-profile-mandatory-in-the-peppol-edelivery-network-from-1-february-2020/)
of OpenPEPPOL related to migration on PEPPOL AS4, has been started
a verification of the adaptation activities of the APs based on AS2.

The roadmap for APs that have not yet performed the AS4 test with the central PEPPOL testbed is as follows:
• Until January 31st 2020 the AS2 profile will be mandatory and the AS4 will be optional
• from 1 February 2020, PEPPOL Service Providers are obliged to support the AS4 profile, while AS2 will be optional.

The link above collects all information related to AS4, in particular:
• [PEPPOL AS4 profile specifications](http://docs.peppol.eu/edelivery/as4/specification/)
• [Guidelines for the execution of acceptance tests of the AS4 Access Point](https://peppol.eu/downloads/ap-guidelines/)
• [AS4 solutions on the market](https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITAL/eDelivery+AS4+conformant+solutions)
 
Therefore the APs are invited to perform the acceptance test for AS4 AP, with consequent sending of the report to OpenPEPPOL - as per guidelines -, by 1 February 2020.
