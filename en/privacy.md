These data, necessary for the use of the web services, are processed
exclusively for the technical management of the site.

#### Cookies and other tracking systems

Cookies are small text files that the website sends to the user's terminal,
where they are stored, and then retransmitted to the same website on the
next visit.

This site uses:

-   technical cookies;

-   analytics cookies used to collect information, in aggregate form, on the
number of users and how they visit the website

The cookies used by the website do not allow any identification or profiling
of the user, who can, in any case, choose to enable or disable cookies, by
appropriately settings their navigation browser according to the

    of static web pages generated from source code hosted on a GitHub
    repository. Please refer to the [privacy

#### Data provided by the data subjects

Sending messages to the contact addresses advertised on the website involves
the acquisition of all personal data voluntarily included by the sender in the
text of their communication, processed for the sole purpose of the requested
response. Personal data are processed for institutional activities related to
the role of AGID as national PEPPOL Authority. As far as the email box
[assistenzaPEPPOL@agid.gov.it](mailto:assistenzaPEPPOL@agid.gov.it) is
concerned, AGID is supported by [Intercent-ER, Agenzia per lo sviluppo dei
mercati telematici of the Emilia-Romagna
Region](https://intercenter.regione.emilia-romagna.it/), as a data processor
pursuant to art. 28 of the Regulation.

#### Legal basis for the processing

The legal basis is identified in the execution of the tasks of public interest
or in any case connected to the exercise of public powers by AGID, pursuant to
article 14-bis of Legislative Decree no. 82/2005 (“Codice dell’Amministrazione
Digitale”), as well as in AGID’s role as national PEPPOL Authority. AGID,
indeed, is the Italian national PEPPOL Authority as a result of joining
[OpenPEPPOL](https://peppol.eu/), an international association whose members
belong to both the public and private sectors and which is responsible for
developing and maintaining the PEPPOL technical specifications, building
blocks, services, and implementation across Europe.

#### Categories of processors of personal data

AGID will process personal data independently through its own staff.

The personal data processors are also providers of technical and telematic
services if they are designated as such.

AGID, as national PEPPOL Authority, does not transfer any personal data to third
countries or to international organisations.

#### Retention period of personal data

Browsing data are deleted immediately after the related statistical processing
and, in any case, are not kept for more than 15 days from the time of
collection, without prejudice to any need for the detection of crimes by the
judicial authority.

The personal data provided by the data subjects are kept for the time strictly
needed for the management and feedback of the communication received.

#### Rights of the data subjects

Data subjects have the right to obtain access, correction or cancellation access
to their personal data, the limitation of the related processing, the right to
object and the right to data portability, where the conditions exist.

Without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial appeal, it is the
right of the data subject to file a complaint with the Data Protection Authority
if it is deemed that the processing of their data violates the Regulation.

AGID guarantees that no exclusively-automated form of decision-making that
entails legal effects on the data subjects is in place.
